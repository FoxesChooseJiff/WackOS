sector 0 : boot loader

Since MysticFS will become a bit complicated, there's no way to bootstrap it within 512 (<510 actually) bytes of code. So we load an additional 15 sectors to greatly expand the boot procedure.
--------------
sector 1: basic data
(in hex)
000(5): Sector signature (HORNY)
005(1): MFS major version
006(1): MFS minor version
007(10): UUID of volume
017(20): Name of volume
037(2): Year of volume creation*
039(2): Month and day of volume creation*
03B(3): Seconds relative to midnight of volume creation time*

*relative to system's CMOS time
--------------
sectors 2 to 14: 2nd part bootstrap code

These sectors will contain some code to load the """"real"""" 2nd stage loader (wdos.bin), and perhaps more features
--------------
secotr 15: (reserved)

This sector is currently reserved and may be used in future modification. It also contains the end signature (CORN) located at the very last 4 bytes
